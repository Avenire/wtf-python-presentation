# Nice handlers
Fix tests (tip: add elif to todo in `error_handlers_v1.py`) and re-run them. Make sure all of them pass. 
Then think about how to refactor this mess. 
Then you can checkout one cool way how to do it - use `error_handler` from module `error_handlers_v2.py`.
Make sure to play with it (you'll know how if you followed todo exactly ;)).
